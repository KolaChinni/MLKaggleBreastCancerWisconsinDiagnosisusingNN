🧠 Breast Cancer Classification – From Scratch to Deep Learning

This repository demonstrates three different approaches to solving a binary classification problem using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.
The project progresses from classical machine learning implemented from scratch, to deep learning using frameworks, and finally to a fully custom deep neural network with Adam optimization built using NumPy only.
